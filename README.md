# Snooker-Queries Description - Tom Melling

After searching for a dataset to practice various SQL techniques on I came across this one about the game of snooker on Kaggle, courtesy of the user *rusiano*:

I have been a fan of snooker for years now and therefore felt I could come up with some pretty intricate and insightful queries to really test my SQL skills. In the end, the data set - which is comprised of a relational database of four tables (*matches*, *tournaments*, *players*, and *scores*) - gave me ample oppurtunity to cover all SQL querying methods.

**Note-** the dataset covers the years 1982-2020, so some query outputs may not match real life, up to date statistics.
